# Code Generation for Decaf Expressions

<p class="text-muted">Start on {{ site.hwdates[3].startdate }}</p>
<p class="text-muted">Due on {{ site.hwdates[3].deadline }}</p>

Your task for this homework is to use LLVM in order to write the code
generation step for expressions and methods in the [Decaf programming
language](decafspec.html).

## LLVM

We will be using a code generation and compiler toolkit called
[LLVM](http://llvm.org/)  for this homework. We will be using LLVM version 
{{ page.llvmver }}. 

Before you start programming for this homework it is very important you work
through the [LLVM practice problems](llvm-practice.html) first.

We will be using various LLVM tools such as `llvm-as` and `llc`.
The easiest way to access the right version of these binaries is
to use `llvm-config-{{ page.llvmver }} --bindir` and add this directory as a
prefix to the LLVM binaries.

We can also use `llvm-config` to generate the necessary command
line options for `g++` or `clang++`

    llvm-config-{{ page.llvmver }} --cppflags --ldflags --libs core mcjit native

The text generated by the above command can be used to tell `g++` or `clang++`
which LLVM libraries to link with your program and where they can be found.

## Getting Started

You must have git and python (3.x) on your system to run the assignments.
Once you've confirmed this, run this command:

    git clone https://github.com/anoopsarkar/compilers-class-hw.git

In the `decafexpr` directory you will find various python programs
which you will use to test your solution to this homework and to
prepare files you will upload to the 
[leaderboard for this homework]({{ site.leaderboard }}) and to
[Coursys]({{ site.coursys }}).

If you have already cloned the repository earlier you can
get the new homework files by going to the directory
where you cloned the repository earlier and then doing:

    # go to the directory where you did a git clone earlier
    git pull origin master

To get started with your homework do the following steps.

### Copy over files to your repository

Assuming you have set up your repository using the instruction in [HW0](hw0.html), 
clone your repository and enter that directory and copy over the decafexpr files:

    git clone git@csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca:YOUR_USERNAME/CMPT379-{{ site.semcode }}-YOUR_USERNAME.git
    cd CMPT379-{{ site.semcode }}-YOUR_USERNAME
    cp -r /your-path-to/compilers-class-hw/decafexpr/* .
    git add *
    git commit -m 'initial commit'
    git push

If you update my repository using `git pull` then you might have to copy over the
new files into your repository. Be careful you do not clobber your own files
in the `answer` directory.

### Default solution

Your solution must be compiled in the `answer` directory and must be called `decafexpr`.
There is an incomplete solution to this homework in the `answer` directory. You can create the `default`
binary as follows:

    cd your-repo-name/answer
    make default

## The Challenge

The goal of this homework is to write a code generator for variables,
simple expressions and methods for the Decaf programming language. The
output will be in LLVM assembly which is compiled to x86 assembly
and then to a binary file. The first step will be to write a symbol
table implementation for your compiler.  The structure of Decaf and
code generation hints are given in the Decaf specification:

> [Decaf specification](decafspec.html)

Read the specification carefully before you attempt to write any code to solve
this homework.

## Your Task

Using the [Decaf language specification](decafspec.html) as your guide, 
you have two steps:

#### Step 1: Symbol Table

Implement a symbol table that can keep track of variables and methods
in Decaf.

A symbol table is a mapping from identifiers to any information that the
compiler needs for code generation. A symbol table is easily implemented using
hash tables or maps, e.g. here is a declaration of a symbol table using STL in
C++:

    typedef map<string, descriptor* > symbol_table;

where a _descriptor_ is a structure or class which contains useful information
about the variable including a _type_, a _register destination_, a _memory
address_ location, and a variable _spilled_ indicating if the value is to be
found in a register or in memory (note that we will not use memory locations
for variables until later). 

In Decaf we are allowed to [_shadow_ a variable
declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing).  This means
that a new definition for an identifier in a block will cause a new descriptor
to be associated with the identifier, but once the block terminates the
previous descriptor for the identifier has to be restored. A simple way to
implement this notion of local scoping is to specify that each block can create
a new symbol table in a list:

    typedef list<symbol_table > symbol_table_list;
    symbol_table_list symtbl;

If a variable has a local definition that shadows another definition
of the same variable name, we pick up the most recently
defined descriptor for that variable by simply scanning the list 
of symbol tables starting from the most recent one:

    descriptor* access_symtbl(string ident) {
        for (symbol_table_list::iterator i = symtbl.begin(); i != symtbl.end(); ++i) {
          symbol_table::iterator find_ident;
          if ((find_ident = i->find(ident)) != i->end())
            return find_ident->second;
        }
        return NULL;
    }

This is just one way to implement a symbol table. You can implement it any way
you like, as long as it can handle shadowing of variables.

For this first step, you can assume that the identifiers are only variables,
but for solving this homework (including Part 2) the symbol table will also
store information about function names, global variables, etc., and additional
information will have to be added to the descriptor.

To test your symbol table implementation, use it to remember the line number of
each variable definition and then introduce a comment line into the input Decaf
program that specifies the line number of the variable definition for that
identifier. 

When entering a new block you should make sure to insert a new symbol table so
that local re-definitions of a variable will shadow higher level definitions.
In order to do this in yacc the easiest way is to add a new non-terminal that
can be used to trigger the action you want to do: either insertion of a new
symbol table or removal of a symbol table for an out of scope block. For
example, let's take a single CFG rule in a yacc program:

    block: '{' var_decl_list statement_list '}'

If we wish to create a new scope region when we scan the `{` it is easier if
the grammar is changed to the equivalent form below:

    block: begin_block var_decl_list statement_list end_block
    begin_block: '{'
    end_block: '}'

But now `begin_block` and `end_block` can support actions such
as creation of a new scope or removal of an old scope.[^1]

[^1]: A more advanced version of the solution to this task is to do the scoping over the entire AST that is created by the parser. Implement the scoping by adding and removing new scopes in your symbol table by doing a top-down pass over the AST. This way of solving it is closer to the top-down code generation in Step 2 of this homework.

Here is an example of what Step 1 should do. For input Decaf program:

    extern func print_int(int) void;
    package C {
        func main() int {
            var x int; 
            x = 1;
            print_int(x);
        }
    }

Your program should print out the following on standard error:

    defined variable: x, with type: int, on line number: 4

And on standard output:

    extern func print_int(int) void;
    package C {
        func main() int {
            var x int; 
            x = 1; // using decl on line: 4
            print_int(x) // using decl on line: 4;
        }
    }

There are some additional testcases available in the `decafsym` directory in
the `compilers-class-hw` git repository.

#### Step 2: Code Generation for Expressions

Provide code generator for the following fragment of Decaf that includes:

* Arithmetic and Boolean expressions.
    * **Warning**: do not attempt [short-circuit of boolean expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation) for this homework.
* Function calls.
* Function definitions (including recursive functions).
* Declaration of extern functions (all extern functions are defined in `decaf-stdlib.c`).

The following AST nodes should have a fully working code generation implemented (except for short-circuiting).

<script src="https://gist.github.com/anoopsarkar/c45e35600f9bef377dbe1a491a56584b.js"></script>

Most of these are trivial to implement using the LLVM API. Only the first one,
arithmetic and boolean expressions is non-trivial. The Decaf language
specification has a section on Semantics which lays out the rules of type
coercion and other gray areas in the implementation of Decaf.

Boolean constants are of type `i1` in LLVM assembly. Char constants can be either `i8` or `i32`. 
You will need to refer to the [LLVM Documentation](http://llvm.org/releases/3.8.0/docs/index.html)
and the [LLVM Tutorial](http://llvm.org/releases/3.8.0/docs/tutorial/index.html).

As shown in [LLVM practice](llvm-practice.html) you should extend your abstract
syntax tree (AST) classes to add LLVM API calls for code generation. Keep all
the AST classes from your parser in HW2. For the AST nodes not mentioned above
just return `nullptr` or `NULL` as the value for the code generation function call. 
For the rest you should make sure the code generation function returns the appropriate
LLVM code block of type `LLVM::Value *`.

#### Requirements

More details about the task is provided by examining the testcases for this homework.

The output should be in LLVM assembly which can be compiled to x86 assembly
using the LLVM tools and run as a binary.  We will use the binary `llvm-run` in
the answer directory to create and run the binary from the Decaf programs in
the testcases directory.

The LLVM assembly and toolchain output is dumped into the `llvm` directory.
You should examine your output to debug your compiler.
Make sure you obey the following requirements:

1. If your program succeeds in parsing the input you should exit from your program using `exit(EXIT_SUCCESS)`. And if your program finds an error in the input Decaf program you should exit using `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)`. The definitions of `EXIT_SUCCESS` and `EXIT_FAILURE` are in `cstdlib` (for C++) and in `stdlib.h` (for C).
1. You must dump the LLVM assembly by calling `TheModule->dump()` where `TheModule` is of type `llvm::Module*`.

## Development and upload procedure

Remember to push your solution source code to your repository:

    cd answer
    git add decafexpr.y decafexpr.lex # and any other files you need for the solution
    git commit -m 'initial solution'
    git push

Then each time you finish a component of your solution you can push it to the remote repository:

    git add [source-file]
    git commit -m 'commit message' [source-file]
    git push

You have been given three helper programs to help you develop your solution to this homework.

### Run your solution on testcases

Run your solution program on the testcases using the Python program `zipout.py`. 
Your solution must be compiled in the `answer` directory and must be called `decafexpr`.
Run against all testcases as follows:

    # go to the directory with the file zipout.py
    python3 zipout.py

This creates a directory called `output` and a file `output.zip` which can be checked against the reference output files 
(see section on _Check your solution_ below).
The file `output.zip` can also be uploaded to the [leaderboard]({{ site.leaderboard }}) when you are ready.

If you run `zipout.py` multiple times it will overwrite your output directory and zip file which should be fine most of the time (but be careful).

### Check your solution

Check your solution accuracy using the Python program `check.py`. You must create an `output.zip` file using the above step in _Run your solution on testcases_.

You can use the default program provided to get an initial solution to this homework. Run `python3 zipout.py -r default` to get a `source.zip` file you can score using `check.py`.

    python3 check.py 
    Correct(dev): 2 / 100
    Score(dev): 2.00
    Total Score: 2.00

### Check accuracy on hidden testcases

For some testcases (those in the `testcases/test` directory) the inputs are provided but the reference output is not provided to you.
To see your performance on those testcases you must submit your `output.zip` to the [leaderboard]({{ site.leaderboard }}).
You will see your performance on test and your accuracy will be displayed on the [class leaderboard page](leaderboard.html).

### Package your source for Coursys

You must also upload your source code to Coursys. You should prepare your source for upload using the Python program `zipsrc.py`.

    # go to the directory with the file zipsrc.py
    python3 zipsrc.py

This will create a zip file called `source.zip`. You should upload this file as your submission to hw1 on [Coursys]({{ site.coursys }}).

**Be careful**: `zipsrc.py` will only package files in the `answer` directory. Make sure you have put all your supporting files in that directory. In particular, put relevant documentation into `answer/docs/README.md`. 

## Ground Rules

* You must turn in two things:
    * Your source code from the `answer` directory as a zip file `source.zip` produced by running `python3 zipsrc.py` must be uploaded to the `hw3` submission page on [Coursys]({{ site.coursys }}).
    * Your output on the testcases which is the file `output.zip` produced by running `python3 zipout.py` must be uploaded to the `hw3` submission page on [Coursys]({{ site.coursys }}). When we run `check.py` on the public testcases it should have a value higher than the output from the default program to get any marks.
* You cannot use data or code resources outside of what is provided to you. If you use external code snippets provide citations in the `answer/README.md` file.
* For future homeworks, for the written description of your solution and supporting documentation, you can use plain ASCII but for math equations it is better to use kramdown. Do not use any proprietary or binary file formats such as Microsoft Word.
