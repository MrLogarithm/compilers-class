Why is it offensive to a professor when you say "we pay your salary so you should answer questions on the weekend" incorrect or misleading when applied to me or to any other faculty member. 

The points below only apply to tenure-track research-faculty like me.

1. I don't have to work on weekends but you might have to. That should be common sense.
2. I bring in $750,000 of research funding to SFU. This is slightly above average for the SFU CS department.
3. I support 10 graduate students entirely from my research funds. This partially enables SFU to have a graduate program that supplies every undergraduate course with TAs.
4. I am expected to publish research papers to put the SFU name on the international research map. My academic evaluation covers both research and teaching.
5. Provincial funding from the BC government barely covers faculty salaries especially in competitive departments like Computer Science. Hence the rapid increase in international students at SFU who pay more tuition.
6. Finally, on a more personal note: I am actually part-time at SFU now, at 25% salary because I am taking some time off to found a start-up company.

The professor-student relation is quite different from a vendor-customer relationship (even in the latter, consider monopolies). We are in charge of vetting you, so we cannot operate in the free-market. Otherwise, whoever pays more tuition will graduate, no matter if they are qualified or not. Think about these things. It will benefit your outlook on education.
