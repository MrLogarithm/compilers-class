## Bugfixes

A few fixes that need to be done from Maryam:

* There are a few keywords/tokens missing from the grammar:
    "." (T_DOT), "extends" (T_EXTENDS), "new" (T_NEW), "null" (T_NULL) 
* In HW2, integer constants are shown as: `Number(int value)`. In the output however `Decaf.asdl` specifies `NumberExpr(int value)`
