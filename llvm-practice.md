## Code Generation with LLVM: Practice Problems

### Clone the repository

The files below and other example programs are available in a git repository

You must have git and python (2.7) on your system. Once you've confirmed this, run this command:

    git clone https://github.com/anoopsarkar/compilers-class-hw.git

If you have already cloned the repository earlier you can
get the new homework files by going to the directory
where you cloned the repository earlier and then doing:

    # go to the directory where you did a git clone earlier
    git pull origin master

Then go to the `llvm-practice` directory

    cd /your-path-to/compilers-class-hw/llvm-practice
